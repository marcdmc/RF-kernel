## Installation

### Creating and activating a virtual environment

To create a python virtual environment for the first time use the command:
```
python3 -m venv .env
```
Then activate the environment and install requirements:
```
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The next time you want to use the environment only activate it using `source .env/bin/activate` and stop it with `deactivate`.
